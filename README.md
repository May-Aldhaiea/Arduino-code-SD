# Arduino-code-SD
this is the arduino code for senior design at SDSU
Here is an automated PCB dispenser, this is only a part of the full machine. This part of the machine is designed to carry out pcb boards either from EFEM's or a real
person and then setting it up and bringing it to the vantage where the parts get glued onto the PCB board. The Setup part consists of heating, suction, clamping and
a lead screw. the board is heated up to the desired tempurature using the GUI which is in https://github.com/ShervinShabanpour/Teleporter_GUI and once the desired
temprature is reached then the board is ready to be moved to the vantage. This Design consists of many sensors that help reduce the amount of errors that happen during 
the automation process. the clamps and the suction help keep the PCB board intact and flat for the dispensing.

Here is a diagram of the part of the machines and how they work: ![alt text](http://url/to/img.png)
